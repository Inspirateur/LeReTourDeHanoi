# Le Re-Tour De Hanoï
Winning game of [UGA IUT2](https://iut2.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) gamejam 2017, cleaned and ported to Python 3.7 (but no feature was added).

Gamejam constraints:
* 4 days
* Python 2.7 and Pygame
* Theme: Combo

*I tried my best to clean the code but it was done dirty and quickly plus we didn't had much coding experience at the time so it's quite unreadable.*
